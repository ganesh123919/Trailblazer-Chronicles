Frequently Asked Questions
1. What is a catalytic converter used for?
A catalytic converter is used to reduce harmful emissions from the exhaust of vehicles, helping to meet environmental standards and improve air quality.

2. How long does a catalytic converter last?
A typical catalytic converter lasts between 10 to 15 years, depending on vehicle usage and maintenance.

3. What is the main function of a catalytic converter?
The main function is to convert toxic gases like carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxides into less harmful substances such as carbon dioxide and water vapor.

4. What are the materials used in a catalytic converter?
Catalytic converters commonly use precious metals such as platinum, palladium, and rhodium as catalysts for chemical reactions in the exhaust system.

5. Can a catalytic converter be repaired?
In most cases, catalytic converters cannot be repaired and need to be replaced if damaged or clogged.

6. How does a catalytic converter improve air quality?
By reducing vehicle emissions, a catalytic converter helps lower air pollution, which improves overall air quality and supports environmental sustainability.

7. What are the symptoms of a failing catalytic converter?
Symptoms of a failing catalytic converter include poor vehicle performance, reduced fuel efficiency, and a sulfur-like odor from the exhaust.

8. Why are catalytic converters expensive?
